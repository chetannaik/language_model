Propaganda is a concerted set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of large numbers of people . 
Instead of impartially providing information , propaganda in its most basic sense presents information in order to influence its audience . 
The most effective propaganda is often completely truthful , but some propaganda presents facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis , or gives loaded messages in order to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented . 
The desired result is a change of the cognitive narrative of the subject in the target audience . 
Propaganda shares techniques with advertising and public relations . 
Advertising and public relations can be thought of as propaganda that promotes a commercial product or shapes the perception of an organization , person or brand , though in post-World War II usage the word `` propaganda '' more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas , since the term had gained a pejorative meaning , which commercial and government entities couldn’t accept . 
The refusal phenomenon was eventually to be seen in politics itself by the substitution of ‘political marketing’ and other designations for ‘political propaganda’ . 
Propaganda was often used to influence opinions and beliefs on religious issues , particularly during the split between the Catholic Church and the Protestants . 
Propaganda has become more common in political contexts , in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments , political groups , but also often covert interests . 
In the early 20th century the term propaganda was also used by the founders of the nascent public relations industry to describe their activities . 
This usage died out around the time of World War II , as the industry started to avoid the word , given the pejorative connotation it had acquired .
